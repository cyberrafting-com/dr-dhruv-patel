                            <h2>Understanding Knee Replacement Surgery</h2>

                            <p>Knee replacement surgery, medically termed knee arthroplasty, is a transformative procedure designed to alleviate pain and restore function in severely damaged knee joints. This surgical intervention entails removing the damaged knee joint surfaces and replacing them with prosthetic components. Knee replacement surgery is a beacon of hope for those grappling with debilitating knee conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or traumatic injuries.</p>
