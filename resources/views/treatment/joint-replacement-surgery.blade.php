                                    <p>Joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty, is a medical procedure aimed at relieving pain and improving the function of a damaged or deteriorated joint. This surgical intervention involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with a prosthetic implant. Joint replacement surgery is most commonly performed on the hip, knee, and shoulder joints, but it can also be done on other joints like the elbow, ankle, and wrist.</p>
