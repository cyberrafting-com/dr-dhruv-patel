                            <p>In today's medical field, doctors possess exceptional intelligence and involve patients in the decision-making process by providing thorough explanations of the potential consequences, treatments, and the pros and cons associated with each option. However, it can be challenging to find a doctor who takes a firm stance and confidently makes a decision. This was the situation my family faced when my mother's index toe wasn't healing due to diabetes. We consulted with multiple doctors, and while each presented various treatment possibilities, they were hesitant and uncertain about the outcomes. Some even suggested amputating the toe. However, Allah led us to a young doctor Dhruv Patel,  with his expertise. He conducted several tests and reassured us, saying, "Do not worry; I will take care of it. Just follow my instructions diligently." Instead of opting for amputation, we chose to trust Dhruv, my mother's toe has fully recovered. We are immensely grateful to Dhruv Patel for his exceptional care and guidance throughout this journey.</p>
